# TI-Team 5-Carbon Footprint App

## Mobile Application to determine Carbon Footprint(Carbon Emission)
To overcome the challenge of global climate change and its consequences, we need to take part in it and should be aware of what role we are playing in it.
Carbon emission is the main reason for increasing global warming. The more percent of the carbon dioxide comes from the vehicles we daily use for transportation.
Providing an application to determine the carbon footprint (carbon emission) of the vehicle used by the individual and let them keep a track of it. 
It will be integrated with Google maps that would help the user to keep track of the routes and carbon emission. 
It will also provide an analysis of the carbon footprint for the routes followed by the user over a period. 
It will also provide the user with the alternate option to switch over to our clean source of transportation services.

## Target Audience:
We are planning to target the people having their vehicle and transportation industry (Cabs Services, courier Service, etc.) in Nova Scotia first and then slowly transition to the other provinces in Canada,
targeting people age between 14-60 years old of any gender. 
We are thinking to target the people who are more concerned about climate change and the global cause. 
Students of environmental studies. People who are willing to be responsible for climate changes
